      p Dr. Bruce Brockman was born and raised in Shawano, a rural community in northeastern Wisconsin. He attended the University of Wisconsin Madison on a full music scholarship playing the French horn.
      p Dr. Brockman moved to Southern California to pursue his professional degree at the Southern California College of Optometry.

      p He interned at the Los Angeles Veterans Clinic and also the Indian Health Facility in White River, Arizona. He enjoys seeing families from infants to great-grandparents. Keeping patient's vision healthy and finding the right vision solution for each patient's needs are two of his highest goals.
      p Dr. Brockman has served on the Board for the Chamber of Commerce and is currently president of the Rotary Club of Ojai (2008-2009). His favorite activity outside the office is golf- which may explain the high handicap! On an occasional Sunday he plays his French horn or sings tenor at the Ojai Presbyterian Church.
